Old School Demo III               
Released by Cosine Systems in 2018

http://www.cosine.org.uk/ 

Config      

This demo does not need installation. Just run the EXE file
to play the demo.  However, the 'gfx' and 'sfx' directories
must be in the same location as the EXE or it will fail.
 
It has been tested on various Windows machines and should run
fine unless you only have a real old machine with slow
onboard graphics. You will need DirectX installed for
it to run.
 
It should work under Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 x64) as long as
instructions at the beginning of the source are 
followed before re-compiling. Thanks to 'StarBootics'
of the PureBasic forum for the tip.
 
Info   

This is a simple demo, expanding on learning done in Old
School Demos 1 and 2.  It was produced in response to a
'challenge' on the DBF Forum calling for Halloween
demos.  The original post can be found here:
 
http://www.dbfinteractive.com/forum/index.php?topic=6784.0

Various routines will find their way into a game soon to
be released by Cosine!

The source is provided as a learning tool for others and,
yes, some bits could be reduced in size using loops, etc.,
but since this is for beginners to follow also, it
has been coded and commented to be as readable and 
friendly as possible.  It should be found in the 'source'
folder.
 
It is common for PureBasic resources to be comverted to
data and included in the compiled EXE.  However, in this
case, all of the graphics are provided in their original
bitmap format so you can see how they all slot together
and how they are used.
 
Extras    

There should be an 'extras' folder included in the
download. This folder contains a few files not directly
used by the demo, but you may find interesting.

The music is in OGG format when loaded in the demo, but the
original MOD that was written especially for this demo is
included so you can see how that was done too. It
was written in OpenMPT, but should load into any tracker
that supports MOD format.  The samples are from the
SoundTracker ST-XX sample disks.
 
There is a hidden part to the demo, consisting of a
simplified recreation of a C64 Halloween demo by
Arkanix Labs.  A C64 disk image of this demo is also
included should you wish to see it but you'll need a
C64 emulator.  There is also a SID file which is the
original C64 music.
